Problem Statement

Imagine the Prime Minister of the country is planning a new city. The Prime Minister calls you and provides information about the location of each house (locate these houses randomly, assume there are 10-20 houses). He requests you to figure out the best place to open 3 restaurants given these houses. (See the figure for better understanding of the problem setting - randomly generated).
